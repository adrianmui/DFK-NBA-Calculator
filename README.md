# DFK-NBA-Calculator
coded in python, incomplete

purpose: Got sick and tired of setting daily line-ups on Draft Kings for NBA Daily Fantasy Contests, so I'm in the process of
writing a simple script to draft my line-ups by manipulating some numbers from player stats data.

Started this project in Early April, resuming now in mid-May.
